About This Portfolio

This website serves as my personal professional portfolio, built using the Helios template by HTML5 UP.
It highlights my work and experience as a Unity developer specializing in C# programming and virtual reality (VR) development.

In addition to software development, I also compose and produce original music, combining technical proficiency with creative design to develop immersive and interactive experiences.
